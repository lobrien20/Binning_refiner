1. These scripts have been transferred to my scratch on Katana (/srv/scratch/z5039045/Binning_refiner), you can call it
directly from my home directory(for Katana users). Any updates or bug-fix will be synchronized to this folder at first time.

2. (Reminder) As CheckM is a memory eating program, CheckM_qsuber.py will submit one job for each input and refined bins.
This will become annoying if you have hundreds of bins, as the same number of emails will influx your email account!
